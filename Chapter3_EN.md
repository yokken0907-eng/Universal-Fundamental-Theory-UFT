Chapter 3: Resolving Cosmic and Geological Anomalies
— The "Embers" in the Earth's Core and the Cosmic Expansion Brake —
The goal of this chapter is to unify two seemingly unrelated fields—geology and cosmology—using a single unified blueprint.

3.1: The Earth's "Hidden Heat Source" — The Missing 20 Terawatts
The Earth generates heat from its interior, but for a long time, there has been a "bug" in the energy balance that has remained unresolved.

The Missing Heat:
The total heat flow from the Earth's interior is approximately 47 TW (Terawatts). Of this, only about 27 TW can be explained by the decay of radioactive elements.

The 20 Terawatt Mystery:
Mainstream geology has often dismissed the remaining 20 TW as "primordial heat" from the Earth's formation. However, that heat could not have been maintained for 4.6 billion years.

The Architect’s Perspective:
If a room is warmer than the output of its heater (radioactive decay), a "hidden stove" must exist. UFT 6.0 has identified that stove.

3.2: Primordial Black Hole at the Earth's Center (Core PBH)
At the very center (core) of the Earth sits a tiny black hole created during the birth of the universe.

PBH Specifications:
Mass: M_PBH ≈ 10^18 kg (roughly the mass of Mt. Everest).
Size: Radius ≈ 0.1 mm (smaller than a grain of sand).

Energy Conversion Efficiency:
By accreting surrounding matter or through "Hawking Radiation," this microscopic black hole supplies exactly 20 TW of thermal energy.

The Architect’s Perspective:
This is the ultimate "ultra-compact, high-efficiency nuclear reactor." It was embedded in the foundation during the design phase to keep the Earth-building warm.

3.3: Why is the Earth Not Swallowed? — Vacuum Viscosity Brake
The question naturally arises: "If there is a black hole inside the Earth, wouldn't it swallow the entire planet?"

Fluid Dynamics Solution:
This is where the "Vacuum Viscosity (xi_vac)" defined in Chapter 1 becomes critical.

Viscous Resistance:
Because the QS (Vacuum Fluid) has a slight stickiness, it applies a powerful brake to the speed at which the black hole sucks in matter.

Equilibrium State:
The "suction force" and the "viscous resistance" are in perfect balance. This allows it to function as a "stable furnace" that emits heat without consuming the planet.

The Architect’s Perspective:
It’s like controlling a powerful engine with "high-viscosity oil" to maintain a safe output. Without this "play" in the system, the Earth would have vanished long ago.

3.4: Resolving Hubble Tension — The Cosmic "Scale Error"
"Hubble Tension"—the discrepancy in the expansion rate of the universe depending on whether we look at the distant or local universe—is the greatest headache in modern cosmology.

Environmental Dependency of the Gravitational Constant G:
In UFT, the gravitational constant G is not a universal "invariant." It changes slightly depending on the density and viscosity (environment) of the surrounding QS.

The Identity of the Bug:
Physicists assumed G was constant. Therefore, a discrepancy arose between the distant universe (low-density past) and the local universe (high-density present).

Numerical Alignment:
When factoring in vacuum viscous resistance, the discrepancy in Hubble Tension (approx. -0.22 mag) disappears mathematically.

The Architect’s Perspective:
It’s like building a skyscraper using a "ruler that changes length depending on the temperature." By accounting for the "expansion and contraction of the ruler," UFT 6.0 correctly aligns the blueprints of the entire universe.

3.5: Planetary Evolution and the "Cradle of Life"
This PBH engine is not unique to Earth.

Mars and Venus:
Mars cooled because its PBH was too small, while Venus saw its balance (viscous resistance) collapse, leading to a runaway effect.

The Miracle of Earth:
Earth exists in a "Design Goldilocks Zone"—a perfect balance between PBH size and QS viscosity that maintains temperatures suitable for life.

Summary of Chapter 3: Points of "Certainty"
"The Earth's 20-terawatt heat deficit is supplied by a grain-sized black hole at its center."

"Vacuum viscosity keeps the black hole stable, preventing it from swallowing the Earth."

"Hubble Tension is caused by the gravitational constant G varying slightly with the cosmic environment."

"Earth is a miraculous structure designed through a perfect balance of geometric chance and physical stability."
